# Copy Open Tab Links in HTML - Browser Extension (currently only Chrome)
## What
Copies the titles and URLs of all open tabs in the current browser window to the clipboard in HTML format.

## Why
At times, when I don't have the patience to save to Pocket or bookmark all the open tabs in the correct folder in the browser's bookmarks collection, I'd like to just quickly grab all the links and titles of the tabs in my current browser window and put them in my note-taking app. I was using one of the extensions that did this for Chrome/Firefox, but I've become more privacy concerned recently and rarely install extensions. 

Also, I like how Edge copies and pastes links in HTML format by default, creating hyperlinks instead of just URLs, unlike Chrome/Firefox, which copies only URLs by default. So even if I want to just copy the URL of a single tab the default copy isn't for me.

So, I was thinking that it should be fairly simple to create an extension. Also, creating an extension has been a long--shelved idea that sounded interesting today for some reason + I had some time.

I'll make a FireFox ver. in future, probably ;).
